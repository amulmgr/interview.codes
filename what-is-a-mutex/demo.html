	<p>Use "Add Thread" to create a new thread. Each thread is either idle, waiting for the mutex, or has acquired the mutex and is processing. Click the "Run" button to have a thread acquire the mutex and start processing. Click "Unlock" to have a thread release the mutex and return to an idle state. Another waiting thread, if any, will then acquire the mutex and continue processing.</p>
	
	<p><b>Note</b>: This of course, only works if you've written the correct code in `mutex.js`. Modify the file, reload the browser, and see if your basic mutex works.</p>
