This is an implementation of binary search, and upper and lower bound in Python. It's the example for the

A quick refresher of this common programming algorithm. Perfect for interview preparation.

In this class, I look at the binary search algorithm. I walk through some samples and provide the basic complexity analysis. In addition to binary search, I explain lower and upper bound searching. Youâ€™ll learn what they are and their purpose.

For all the algorithms, I provide a walkthrough of sample code. The code is available for you to review.
